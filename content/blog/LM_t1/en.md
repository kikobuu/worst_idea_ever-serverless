# Why I Dislike Genshin Impact and the Wave of Copycat Products

> **Disclaimer**: This article is a subjective blog post written at the request of a user, representing the perspective of a hypothetical author. Terms like “plagiarism” and “black and red marketing” are used for critical purposes and do not have legal implications. The gaming industry is a complex ecosystem of creativity and business. It is the freedom of consumers to appreciate or criticize products. Let's discuss these issues rationally.

## Introduction

In the current domestic gaming scene, Genshin Impact is undoubtedly a phenomenon. It has achieved tremendous commercial success and has pushed trends such as open-world design, gacha systems, and cross-platform play to new heights. However, from the perspective of a player who values originality and the future of the industry, I have deep concerns and dissatisfaction with this game and the wave of copycat products it has inspired.

My disapproval is not about a dislike for the specific team behind Genshin Impact, but rather a concern about a particular trajectory the industry is taking. When “plagiaristic marketing” becomes a strategy to generate attention, and when “black and red” tactics are seen as a means of growth, and when the industry becomes addicted to relying on established design patterns, the spirit of originality is gradually eroded.

## The Start of the Controversy: Borrowing Without Acknowledgment

Even before Genshin Impact was announced, discussions about its similarities to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild began. There were clear similarities in visual styles, physics feedback, and even some aspects of the user interface. While borrowing and paying tribute to existing works is a common part of the creative process, the way these similarities were presented and the subsequent media discussions raised questions.

What was more troubling was the **manipulation of public opinion** around these similarities. Whether intentionally or not, some early promotional materials seemed to suggest that Genshin Impact was doing something better than Zelda, which led to hostility between fans of both games. This kind of ambiguous handling of inspiration can easily ignite conflicts and generate significant attention—a tactic in marketing that is often referred to as “black and red marketing” in this context.

“Black and red marketing” becomes effective when it is seen as a means to quickly turn negative attention into positive exposure. When this logic becomes the standard, the focus shifts from whether a product is good to how much buzz it can create.

## The Trend of Copycatting and Path Dependence: A Reflection on Low Originality

After Genshin Impact’s success, a plethora of games with similar open-world and gacha systems emerged. The repetition of established design elements, from character movements to narrative structures and economic models, reflects a lack of innovative effort. The reasons for this are:

1. **High Risks and Low Returns for Originality**: Investors prefer proven models that guarantee quick returns, such as gacha systems and character collection.
2. **Compressed Development Times**: The process from concept to release is often compressed to just 6–12 months, leaving little time for in-depth refinement.
3. **A Disconnection between Education and Industry**: Graduates in art and interactive design struggle to enter mainstream gaming companies.
4. **Challenges for Independent Studios**: Lack of funding, channels, and marketing resources makes it difficult for innovative projects to sustain.
5. **Lack of Cultural Confidence**: Local themes are often simplified, and there is a tendency to blindly follow foreign successful models without a deep understanding of local player preferences.

## The Dangers of Copycatting and Path Dependence

The consequences of this are evident:
- Players' experiences are controlled by chance and money, limiting room for innovation.
- This leads to a long-term loss of dedicated players and negative sentiment within the community.
- The repetitive nature of these games means that maps and systems often become mere decorations, lacking unique stories and depth.

## A Call for Genuine Innovation

What I dislike is not Genshin Impact itself, but the industry atmosphere it has created—a situation where “plagiaristic marketing” and reliance on established patterns are seen as legitimate strategies. If we continue to accept these practices as a norm, genuine, locally inspired original IPs and innovative gameplay will remain marginalized.

The solution lies in:
- Encouraging originality through government support and industry initiatives that reduce the barriers to creative development.
- Fostering a diverse talent pool through collaboration between universities and companies in game design, storytelling, and art.
- Practicing responsible marketing that respects the original works and builds a reputation on the quality of the content.
- Involving players in the early stages of game development through community participation and feedback.

**Vision**: Domestic games can move from simply following trends to leading the way with unique cultural perspectives, deeply designed systems, and genuine communication with players.

## Conclusion

The issue is not with Genshin Impact specifically, but with the industry's approach. We need products that are innovative and differentiated, designs that respect user experience, and a positive media environment that values quality over buzz. Only then can we move from simply following trends to truly leading the way in the gaming industry.
